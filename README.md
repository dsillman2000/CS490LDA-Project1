## Organization

Models are included in the `\models` folder.
Testing files are in the `\testing` folder, to which `\testing\data` contains files for benchmarking.
Generally these are `.csv` files where rows represent a given dataset size, and columns represent the number of queries, each cell being the average number of time for the combination.
